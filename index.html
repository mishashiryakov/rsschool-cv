                <h2>English</h2>
                <p>I have been studying English at school and university for about 15 years. I've always loved to speak it  
                    and to understand more their culture. I've never talked to a native speaker before I had a chance to visit  
                    the USA via work&travel programm for studens. Three month of summer 2017 I spent in the US and it  
                    was the best practice of English for me, I suppose. I worked as a waiter and everyday I communicated  
                    with native speakers who visited the restaurant I worked at. The whole team was also American.  
                    So English language takes a big part in my life experience.
